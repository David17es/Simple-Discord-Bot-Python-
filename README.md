# Simple Discord Bot (Python)
This is a simple project that allows Discord users to import a bot to their servers. It basically sends a meme every time it gets called with the keyword '$meme'.

Note: It is mandatory to create a bot first through the Discord app, or else this code won't work without the token you are given.
